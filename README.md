### âš¡ About Me
Iâ€™m a life-long learner and self-starter driven by the belief that thereâ€™s always room for growth. 
Whether itâ€™s developing AI-driven platforms to help farmers meet regulatory challenges, building apps that reduce daily frustrations, or designing embedded systems for spacecraft, Iâ€™m in constant pursuit of creating products that make life better for others.

I thrive on turning ideas into reality, where I'm not just writing code, but also meeting face-to-face with the customer to understand their painpoints.
